# ECON-220-Lab
This contains my materials for ECON 220 (Data Science for Economists) Laboratory Course at Emory University.

This content is partly based on the course materials of [Prof. Hau Nguyen, Ph.D.](https://economics.emory.edu/people/faculty/biography/nguyen-hau.html) and [Justin Eloriaga](https://justineloriaga.com/). Special thanks to them.
